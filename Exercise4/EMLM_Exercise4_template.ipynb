    "## Nested cross-validation for feature selection\n",
    "In this exercise, the task is to use leave-one-out cross-validation for model selection to understand the effect of the winner's curse. \n",
    "This is demonstrated by using greedy forward selection and a random binary data set.\n",
    "The data set is a balanced sample of size 60 (i.e. 30 positives and 30 negatives) with a hundred features. The data are i.i.d., and every feature follows a Bernoulli distribution with $p=0.5$. Thus, there is no signal in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model to be used is 1-nearest neighbour with 10 features, and the greedy forward selection is used to select the best 10 features among all the features.\n",
    "Leave-one-out cross-validation is used for performance evaluation, and the prediction performance is measured as accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy forward feature selection\n",
    "Greedy forward feature selection is an iterative feature selection process, where the features are selected one by one, avoiding a need to iterate through every possible combination of features. The features are selected as follows:\n",
    "- First, every feature is tested solely and the best is selected.\n",
    "- Then the selected feature is tested together with any other remaining feature and the best such a set of two features is selected.\n",
    "- Then that set of the selected two features is tested together with any other remaining feature and the best set of three features is selected.\n",
    "- The process is then continued accordingly until the desired amount of features is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implement the following tasks to complete this exercise:\n",
    "1. Use leave-one-out cross-validation to select the best 10 features. Report the optimal set of features and the corresponding accuracy.\n",
    "2. Use nested leave-one-out cross-validation (leave-one-out on both layers of cross-validation) to obtain an estimate of the prediction accuracy on unseen data, when the final hypotheses are obtained according to the procedure in the first step.\n",
    "3. Explain the difference in the obtained accuracies."
